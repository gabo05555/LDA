"In this paper, a robust 3D triangular mesh watermarking algorithm based on 3D segmentation is proposed. In this algorithm three classes of watermarking are combined. First, we segment the original image to many different regions. Then we mark every type of region with the corresponding algorithm based on their curvature value. The experiments show that our watermarking is robust against numerous attacks including RST transformations, smoothing, additive random noise, cropping, simplification and remeshing.","['S.

"We studied an autoassociative neural network with dynamic synapses which include a facilitating mechanism. We have developed a general mean-field framework to study the relevance of the different parameters defining the dynamics of the synapses and their influence on the collective properties of the network. Depending on these parameters, the network shows different types of behaviour including a retrieval phase, an oscillatory regime, and a non-retrieval phase. In the oscillatory phase, the network activity continously jumps between the stored patterns. Compared with other activity-dependent mechanisms such as synaptic depression, synaptic facilitation enhances the network ability to switch among the stored patterns and, therefore, its adaptation to external stimuli. A detailed analysis of our system reflects an efficient-more rapid and with lesser errors-network access to the stored information with stronger facilitation. We also present a set of Monte Carlo simulations confirming our analytical results.","['Joaquín J. Torres', 'Jesús M. Cortés', 'Joaquín Marro', 'Hilbert J.

"It is well-known that Sturmian sequences are the non ultimately periodic sequences that are balanced over a 2-letter alphabet. They are also characterized by their complexity: they have exactly $(n+1)$ distinct factors of length $n$. A natural generalization of Sturmian sequences is the set of infinite episturmian sequences. These sequences are not necessarily balanced over a $k$-letter alphabet, nor are they necessarily aperiodic. In this paper, we characterize balanced episturmian sequences, periodic or not, and prove Fraenkel's conjecture for the special case of episturmian sequences. It appears that balanced episturmian sequences are all ultimately periodic and they can be classified in 3 families.","['Genevi eve Paquin', 'Laurent Vuillon']",50,"['1c655ee2-067d-4bc4-b8cc-bc779e9a7f10', '2e4e57ca-d190-4bc7-b7ad-2e33aca2f574', '508ea83a-035b-4542-a315-9247c172d255', '666a65af-8657-43f6-b765-f2b72a16726a', '8100bfb7-3f6a-4269-bba8-7c4a6a578570', '8e035cc6-d692-4532-bb3c-a6a34b4db83a', 'e10a00d9-bb59-4f19-8f1c-85917bc03b5f']",A characterization of balanced episturmian sequences,Electronic Journal of Combinatorics,2007,4ab3a4cf-1d96-4ce5-ab6f-b3e19fc260de
"One of the fundamental challenges of recognizing actions is accounting for the variability that arises when arbitrary cameras capture humans performing actions. In this paper, we explicitly identify three important sources of variability: (1) viewpoint, (2) execution rate, and (3) anthropometry of actors, and propose a model of human actions that allows us to investigate all three. Our hypothesis is that the variability associated with the execution of an action can be closely approximated by a linear combination of action bases in joint spatio-temporal space. We demonstrate that such a model bounds the rank of a matrix of image measurements and that this bound can be used to achieve recognition of actions based only on imaged data. A test employing principal angles between subspaces that is robust to statistical fluctuations in measurement data is presented to find the membership of an instance of an action. The algorithm is applied to recognize several actions, and promising results have been obtained.","['Yaser Sheikh', 'Mumtaz Sheikh', 'Mubarak Shah']",221,"['056116c1-9e7a-4f9b-a918-44eb199e67d6', '05ac52a1-dfa2-4c32-9a54-6c1e58cfcca5', '0b2f71cc-6797-445a-82df-5be29945c0a7', '60cf9842-c3aa-463d-a5cf-17fbb8f99ccd', '7a3bb575-8313-4e77-a008-ee5cde444746', '7eda9b91-21f1-490f-8ef2-f94e81c558a4', '905461e4-643b-4da0-a669-f52318b9e126', 'be336575-9974-411d-b637-45440213cbd4', 'be9527aa-97e2-4951-86d1-cc6130cbb777', 'f0d57def-3340-49be-a1c3-cbc996af8dec']",Exploring the space of a human action,international conference on computer vision,2005,4ab3a98c-3620-47ec-b578-884ecf4a6206

"Queueing networks with multiple classes of customers play a fundamental role for evaluating the performance of both software and hardware architectures. The main strength of product–form models, in particular of BCMP queueing networks, is that they combine a flexible formalism with efficient analysis techniques and solution algorithms. In this paper we provide an algorithm that starting from a high–level description of a system, and from the definition of its components in terms of interacting sub–systems, computes a multiple–class and multiple–chain BCMP queueing network. We believe that the strength of this approach is twofold. First, the modeller deals with simplified models, which are defined in a modular and hierarchical way. Hence, we can carry on sensitivity analysis that may easily include structural changes (and not only on the time parameters). Second, maintaining the product–form property allows one to derive the average system performance indices very efficiently.

"A CMOS oscillator employing differential transistor pairs working in Class-C in push-pull configuration is presented. The oscillator exhibits the same advantages enjoyed by complementary topologies on oscillators based on a single differential pair, while yielding a substantial power consumption reduction thanks to the Class-C operation. The phase-noise performance and the fundamental conditions required to keep the transistors working in Class-C are analyzed in detail. It is shown that, for an optimal performance, both nMOS and pMOS transistors should not be pushed into the deep triode region by the instantaneous resonator voltage, and a simple circuit solution is proposed to accommodate a large oscillation swing. A 0.18- μm CMOS prototype of the (voltage-controlled) oscillator displays an oscillation frequency from 6.09 to 7.50 GHz. The phase noise at 2-MHz offset is below -120 dBc/Hz with a power dissipation of 2.2 mW, for a state-of-the-art figure-of-merit ranging from 189 to 191 dBc/Hz.","['Andrea Mazzanti', 'Pietro Andreani']",50,"['0a09db01-264a-4bdf-942c-d33cceb35d3c', '36c942df-7fcb-40b8-b023-a3a4001f632e', '84c00b06-a611-4082-89f7-df2d5540d210', 'a5496509-ebaf-472b-bc83-2e7c503e55bf', 'b8b564ca-0651-4fd4-8db0-0f7710e25ce1', 'bb1ed638-e3c3-46f7-adf9-6977afca564a', 'e3a35338-4747-46f7-b752-5690a5c3c84a', 'f277b0e7-3f23-4a22-ac17-fc6c6019c664']",A Push–Pull Class-C CMOS VCO,IEEE Journal of Solid-state Circuits,2013,4ab3f7cd-140b-4e29-99d4-f4e8006c4f65
"In statistical setting of the pattern recognition problem the number of examples required to approximate an unknown labelling function is linear in the VC dimension of the target learning class. In this work we consider the question whether such bounds exist if consider only computable pattern recognition methods, assuming that the unknown labelling function is also computable. We find that in this case the number of examples required for a computable method to approximate the labelling function not only is not linear, but grows faster (in the VC dimension of the class) than any computable function. No time or space constraints are put on the predictors or target functions; the only resource we consider is the training examples.#R##N##R##N#The task of pattern recognition is considered in conjunction with another learning problem — data compression.

"In 1999, Iwan Duursma defined the zeta function for a linear code as a generating function of its Hamming weight enumerator. It can also be defined for other homogeneous polynomials not corresponding to existing codes. If the homogeneous polynomial is invariant under the MacWilliams transform, then its zeta function satisfies a functional equation and we can formulate an analogue of the Riemann hypothesis. As far as existing codes are concerned, the Riemann hypothesis is believed to be closely related to the extremal property. In this article, we show there are abundant polynomials invariant by the MacWilliams transform which satisfy the Riemann hypothesis. The proof is carried out by explicit construction of such polynomials. To prove the Riemann hypothesis for a certain class of invariant polynomials, we establish an analogue of the Enestrom-Kakeya theorem.",['Koji Chinen'],0,"['02d38c7d-3baf-40e3-86d7-a8884ff503f4', '078e6ac3-f385-42e2-a966-5ca05b98588a', 'b06b90e7-36f4-418a-82b2-656645469cf6', 'b86d2872-8125-4909-957a-d1e0f9cacb90']",An abundance of invariant polynomials satisfying the Riemann hypothesis,Discrete Mathematics,2008,4ab459ce-5f18-4cc0-9627-1dc557eb8b68
"Entity Resolution (ER) is the problem of identifying which records in a database refer to the same real-world entity. An exhaustive ER process involves computing the similarities between pairs of records, which can be very expensive for large datasets. Various blocking techniques can be used to enhance the performance of ER by dividing the records into blocks in multiple ways and only comparing records within the same block. However, most blocking techniques process blocks separately and do not exploit the results of other blocks. In this paper, we propose an  iterative blocking framework  where the ER results of blocks are reflected to subsequently processed blocks. Blocks are now iteratively processed until no block contains any more matching records. Compared to simple blocking, iterative blocking may achieve higher accuracy because reflecting the ER results of blocks to other blocks may generate additional record matches. Iterative blocking may also be more efficient because processing a block now saves the processing time for other blocks. We implement a scalable iterative blocking system and demonstrate that iterative blocking can be more accurate and efficient than blocking for large datasets.","['Steven Euijong Whang', 'David Menestrina', 'Georgia Koutrika', 'Martin Theobald', 'Hector Garcia-Molina']",211,"['0b5e0bfa-12ff-4175-9d65-d8cc62552ae6', '2cba753f-24b1-4b6c-8d36-b9bf66bd1477', '33d18bee-c873-4cf5-8962-e79a032cbdf3', '3960350c-fc91-4fae-83f3-69899d9c8a6f', '5d57c4fa-8dda-4e92-b42b-67f8d16f8602', '717f3af1-aa86-41db-90e5-bfb94ecf8616', '71e35609-693a-4036-9bac-861a7ce7c868', '76c1da70-2949-47c3-aefa-9d703c884cd3', '78001688-d865-4fda-a2eb-d5097c93bbb9', '866e99e1-f1d4-4be9-be12-1f3fe444fc52', '8cf0f572-0507-48cf-9ada-37c152f5810f', '99ac2c24-4d9a-4a96-a9a7-4ada6393677e', '9ff322c1-64c8-49e5-9c23-4b380eff5f10', 'b123d7d1-cced-41cc-a8fc-c710a8f8a736', 'b22383b0-6528-4156-9069-472d895438c3', 'b55b3100-5054-4d25-860d-d3e32fc56d14', 'c9b221ed-7083-4ae7-835c-8e8bd5af22ec', 'fb565ef1-0650-4e55-b68a-1936d8ddb188']",Entity resolution with iterative blocking,international conference on management of data,2009,4ab46288-3a29-471f-95c9-9926df1f93ce
"Performance analysts profile their programs to find methods that are worth optimizing: the ""hot"" methods. This paper shows that four commonly-used Java profilers ( xprof , hprof , jprofile, and yourkit ) often disagree on the identity of the hot methods. If two profilers disagree, at least one must be incorrect. Thus, there is a good chance that a profiler will mislead a performance analyst into wasting time optimizing a cold method with little or no performance improvement.   This paper uses causality analysis to evaluate profilers and to gain insight into the source of their incorrectness. It shows that these profilers all violate a fundamental requirement for sampling based profilers: to be correct, a sampling-based profilermust collect samples randomly.   We show that a proof-of-concept profiler, which collects samples randomly, does not suffer from the above problems. Specifically, we show, using a number of case studies, that our profiler correctly identifies methods that are important to optimize; in some cases other profilers report that these methods are cold and thus not worth optimizing.","['Todd Mytkowicz', 'Amer Diwan', 'Matthias Hauswirth', 'Peter F.

Instead of extracting regions of interest for retargeting, the uninteresting parts are removed from the scene in Shai Avidan and Shamir, A. (2007). This is done by computing the RGB variance within non-overlapping 3times3 blocks and removing the block path with minimal variance cost using dynamic programming.

"Scalable storage architectures allow for the addition of disks to increase storage capacity and/or bandwidth. In its general form, disk scaling also refers to disk removals when either capacity needs to be conserved or old disk drives are retired. Assuming random placement of blocks on multiple nodes of a continuous media server, our optimization objective is to redistribute a minimum number of media blocks after disk scaling. This objective should be met under two restrictions. First, uniform distribution and hence a balanced load should be ensured after redistribution. Second, the redistributed blocks should be retrieved at the normal mode of operation in one disk access and through low complexity computation. We propose a technique that meets the objective, while we prove that it also satisfies both restrictions. The SCADDAR approach is based on using a series of REMAP functions which can derive the location of a new block using only its original location as a basis.","['Ashish Goel', 'Cyrus Shahabi', 'Shu-Yuen Didi Yao', 'Roger Zimmermann']",70,"['1d950f41-7ecc-4243-a2bc-e91242887637', '57868e44-9a01-488a-989f-fd18a57a790f', '60e1ce59-a6a3-49dc-9727-3c02d166188a', '72f144d2-8bfc-4eb1-ba37-8cf9ef190a52', '73c49f25-1710-42b9-bc25-e12c3d47f3de', '756dc97f-4124-4692-bf08-c227c4d6d58f', '9e0fc090-adfe-4482-a1a0-b7037922db10', 'a5385305-4572-443e-bcaa-1297e87aaabb', 'ad9ae838-b7be-4c54-9536-1ba11cf2ff92', 'befc800b-996e-4798-b300-303126ad8fd8', 'e3fc9188-4c99-404e-a22c-7ae7413f0238', 'fd8e4a2e-4e59-4c80-982f-d7ac6db3fe54']",SCADDAR: an efficient randomized technique to reorganize continuous media blocks,international conference on data engineering,2002,4ab50bd7-8e59-4974-a6d0-59a577dcc10d

"Freezing tolerance in plants is obtained during a period of low nonfreezing temperatures before the winter sets on, through a biological process known as cold acclimation. Cold is one of the major stress factors that limits the growth, productivity and distribution of plants, and understanding the mechanism of cold tolerance is therefore important for crop improvement. Expressed sequence tags (EST) analysis is a powerful, economical and time-efficient way of assembling information on the transcriptome. To date, several EST sets have been generated from cold-induced cDNA libraries from several different plant species. In this study we utilize the variation in the frequency of ESTs sampled from different cold-stressed plant libraries, in order to identify genes preferentially expressed in cold in comparison to a number of control sets. The species included in the comparative study are oat (Avena sativa), barley (Hordeum vulgare), wheat (Triticum aestivum), rice (Oryza sativa) and Arabidopsis thaliana. However, in order to get comparable gene expression estimates across multiple species and data sets, we choose to compare the expression of tentative ortholog groups (TOGs) instead of single genes, as in the normal procedure. We consider TOGs as preferentially expressed if they are detected as differentially expressed by a test statistic and up-regulated in comparison to all control sets, and/or uniquely expressed during cold stress, i.e., not present in any of the control sets. The result of this analysis revealed a diverse representation of genes in the different species. In addition, the derived TOGs mainly represent genes that are long-term highly or moderately expressed in response to cold and/or other stresses.","['Angelica Lindlöf', 'Marcus Bräutigam', 'Aakash Chawade', 'Björn Olsson', 'Olof Olsson']",0,"['9b8ad98f-1db8-4201-8246-cbc0812606d8', 'e5b94864-84e2-4833-9df5-6189c844654a']",Identification of cold-induced genes in cereal crops and arabidopsis through comparative analysis of multiple EST sets,bioinformatics research and development,2007,4ab54610-4947-46c7-bd56-fc672dfba5cc
"This position paper concerns itself with real-time safety critical distributed systems. It presents a computational model that is appropriate for this type of application and architecture. It then defines a resource allocations scheme based upon fixed priority scheduling. Such a scheme has the advantage (over purely static schedules) of supporting greater levels of flexibility and non-determinism, whilst still providing static guarantees of necessary timing behaviour (i.e. end-to-end deadlines through the systems). Priority based communication protocols are investigated, with possible future techniques reviewed.","['Alan Burns', 'Neil C. Audsley', 'Andy J.

"a b s t r a c t The constant pressure–temperature (P–T) flash plays an important role in the modelling of fluid-phase behaviour, and its solution is especially challenging for equations of state in which the volume is expressed as an implicit function of the pressure. We explore the relative merits of solving the P–T flash in two ensembles: mole numbers, pressure and temperature, in which each free-energy evaluation requires the use of a numerical solver; and mole numbers, volume and temperature, in which a direct evaluation of the free-energy is possible. We examine the performance of two algorithms, HELD (Helmholtz free energy Lagrangian dual), introduced in Pereira et al. (2012), and GILD (Gibbs free energy Lagrangian dual), introduced here, for the fluid-phase equilibria of 8 mixtures comprising up to 10 components, using two equations of state. While the reliability of both algorithms is comparable, the computational cost of HELD is consistently lower; this difference becomes increasingly pronounced as the number of components is increased. © 2014 The Authors.

"Virtual position-based routing protocols have many attractive characteristics for wireless sensor networks. Typically, such protocols use a proactive scheme for updating routing tables. Because sensor networks can have very low data rate, sending periodic beacons to update routing tables can be very expensive. Instead, reactive approaches might be more appropriate in such scenarios. MANET-inspired reactive routing protocols do not scale well because of the effort in the order of O(n) for each routing information update. In this paper, we present Reactive Virtual Cord Protocol (RVCP), a data-centric reactive virtual position based routing protocol for use in sensor networks. Route discovery is directed towards the destination and hence there is no need to flood the entire network to discover a route. Our approach is based on Virtual Cord Protocol (VCP), an efficient, virtual relative position based routing protocol that also provides support for data management as known from typical Distributed Hash Table (DHT) services. To minimize the end-to-end delay and energy consumption, we used adaptive techniques for the development of RVCP.","['Abdalkarim Awad', 'Andreas Mitschele-Thiel', 'Falko Dressler']",1,"['0d4d0363-07b5-43b6-976d-955e96044709', '29424b9c-c448-4679-8472-044e701a11ea', '2f4e35f1-6dca-46f6-8157-980564a94da0', '3382adea-17b5-4515-a0a7-043f78493e0e', '5bbcc50b-0f4b-4c51-8487-0630f8400f61', '60fb0dc2-bde3-4714-948e-de0ed12ab460', '6288f6da-12ac-4f71-b3dd-37fe580b6793', '6bb012bc-9e9e-4b8d-8098-9b972e612593', '7bd442a1-fb27-4e38-8635-d4c0367f3e2d', '7d42815c-daac-4c27-a9a3-39bd29536fed', '7f9d2a8a-12d1-4944-8c82-99eade0d7442', '8ee59530-fc2a-4b2f-92d0-c241e654f52c', 'ada4eba5-6923-4b92-bf17-9fd360a90b14', 'd381281a-14a0-4d73-993f-723a06096a09', 'e52fc0f5-b2e0-4ecc-a145-3e4e20178da8']",Reactive Virtual Position-Based Routing in Wireless Sensor Networks,international conference on computer communications and networks,2011,4ab5d145-0ea8-49b5-b517-93677e7cbe88

"In this paper, a weighting-delay-based method is developed for the study of the stability problem of a class of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with time-varying delay. Different from previous results, the delay interval [0, d(t)] is divided into some variable subintervals by employing weighting delays. Thus, new delay-dependent stability criteria for RNNs with time-varying delay are derived by applying this weighting-delay method, which are less conservative than previous results. The proposed stability criteria depend on the positions of weighting delays in the interval [0, d(t)], which can be denoted by the weighting-delay parameters. Different weighting-delay parameters lead to different stability margins for a given system. Thus, a solution based on optimization methods is further given to calculate the optimal weighting-delay parameters. Several examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed criteria.","['Huaguang Zhang', 'Zhenwei Liu', 'Guang-Bin Huang', 'Zhanshan Wang']",266,"['11560f85-2543-466f-b338-5ef10a073db7', '14feaffa-1566-44d0-b798-80c027655c1a', '2b258346-2416-4156-abcf-f8f3c3bc99c4', '36739ece-b2b9-4c95-8e96-e1135048101c', '38d20ba0-db8e-47db-ab6b-f2898683a0a1', '4b782405-24db-456f-a058-2b8fd79ea3db', '56d975c5-f372-4eee-8667-1cae480cb57c', '669f9f47-d6bf-462e-b2a6-8300ac07835b', '714a8cc0-486f-4259-bb81-66b5f248e016', '758bcb76-b6a4-415b-8403-1fcd1a8c5643', 'b5af1799-bc84-45f5-823c-193b846455d7', 'b6bbf822-292c-4dfa-a98b-d61b798446cc', 'b76d4f7b-2eac-4eae-8a9d-bd21123e4356', 'bee7d6d4-1d2f-4b8b-951e-466c8e67785b', 'd32e8c91-9c64-438b-bee6-2c89ddb2db0a', 'd8263bb4-5ecb-454a-96b0-fb9a84be03b9', 'dc0ffeb4-7087-4f36-b599-43bb8de95ad1', 'f40a5ee9-78d1-40c9-ae7f-bc4cfc143624', 'f93b2e01-ba5c-47c3-94f3-de9ac10991d9']",Novel Weighting-Delay-Based Stability Criteria for Recurrent Neural Networks With Time-Varying Delay,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks,2010,4ab5e3f4-9b58-4fbb-9bde-ee2f2185cc61
"Search for information is no longer exclusively limited within the native language of the user, but is more and more extended to other languages. This gives rise to the problem of cross-language information retrieval (CLIR), whose goal is to find relevant information written in a different language to a query. In addition to the problems of monolingual information retrieval (IR), translation is the key problem in CLIR: one should translate either the query or the documents from a language to another. However, this translation problem is not identical to full-text machine translation (MT): the goal is not to produce a human-readable translation, but a translation suitable for finding relevant documents. Specific translation methods are thus required. The goal of this book is to provide a comprehensive description of the specifi c problems arising in CLIR, the solutions proposed in this area, as well as the remaining problems. The book starts with a general description of the monolingual IR and CLIR problems. Different classes of approaches to translation are then presented: approaches using an MT system, dictionary-based translation and approaches based on parallel and comparable corpora. In addition, the typical retrieval effectiveness using different approaches is compared. It will be shown that translation approaches specifically designed for CLIR can rival and outperform high-quality MT systems. Finally, the book offers a look into the future that draws a strong parallel between query expansion in monolingual IR and query translation in CLIR, suggesting that many approaches developed in monolingual IR can be adapted to CLIR. The book can be used as an introduction to CLIR. Advanced readers can also find more technical details and discussions about the remaining research challenges in the future. It is suitable to new researchers who intend to carry out research on CLIR.",['Jian-Yun Nie'],108,"['05da32dc-92b9-49a6-86f0-54b6dfc51502', '0d2d8a21-065a-4f1f-a167-4eeb8222ca3c', '17137631-a0ab-48e6-8ffb-607ec171f5a5', '333a3435-4b92-4958-92c9-ec3ac586c063', '34d0159e-4244-474f-a9cf-758b0ebb5ecb', '41fc1b12-bc24-4259-b263-4792ca3572a7', '48bc5327-f3a0-4efc-860f-8ef399c43f77', '49945432-7716-4bbf-af7b-c164405548b3', '5443ee2f-a083-4829-bfd3-b92e50b6d78e', '56bdde8a-8fcf-46e0-a426-ce2d695d4e62', '6741ecf3-e230-44a8-9ad0-a2ca2804b93e', '7f2449b4-c535-4d5a-a322-56cc7cffd463', '808c6e5d-4f8a-4aae-9251-0daa41e97f81', '81e1e9ee-2fa2-42ff-8880-b3c66423f276', '81f773c9-9844-43b5-8a63-f9e1f6e1ace8', '88aac5cb-119b-4c92-8271-d94d51e18b90', '894abe0d-19ac-44cc-9e25-d8f4ce1ee44f', '8cfd8f8d-2580-47e6-8e97-7cb448f292a9', '934cae12-e8ed-4394-aad0-5b0148113804', '9bdbf6d6-db2b-4114-969a-37b4e03993b0', 'a26bb4d3-8093-47e5-b755-efed705c4bbd', 'a3b4fc64-334a-44ac-8485-f8d8ca866fe5', 'b535d6b7-ec76-45d1-a35b-38d38dcaa976', 'c388859a-bdcf-408c-ad63-3754a3b989da', 'cce3336d-27a2-4737-b4df-133d8db7dd71', 'eb306335-b866-47c2-a410-d6d2c177bafe', 'f450b6e2-3ae2-46f2-804a-42d4518d956d', 'f4be32eb-646b-4d3f-aec7-8dad39edb522', 'f8f0f0d6-30e6-4581-8f05-1f6204fd43b3']",Cross-Language Information Retrieval,Synthesis Lectures on Human Language Technologies,2010,4ab5e4bd-08e2-4007-825c-d34ce7cb231f
